## What is R?
R is a programming language and free software environment for statistical computing and
graphics supported by the R Foundation for Statistical Computing. The R language is widely
used among statisticians and data miners for developing statistical software and data analysis.  [See More](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language))

## Key Points 
- This is an easy question to answer. R is a dialect of S(R is an
implementation of the S programming language).
- R was created by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman at the University of Auckland, New
Zealand, and is developed by the R Development Core Team.

- R is a programming language and environment commonly used in **statistical computing**, **data analytics** and **scientific research**.
- It is one of the most popular languages used by **statisticians**, **data analysts**, **researchers** and **marketers to retrieve**, clean, analyze, **visualize** and present data.

## Why R?
- R is open source and free!
- R is popular â€“ and increasing in popularity
- R runs on all platforms
- R is being used by the biggest tech giants(google, facebook, microsoft, twitter)

## Applications of R
- Data Science
- Data Analysis
- Genomic Data Science
- Biological Data Analysis
- Mutational Signature Analysis
- Genomic Analysis
- Statistical Computing
- Machine Learning

## Important Packages 
- [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) -- for data management 
- [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) -- for static data visualization
- [Plotly](https://plotly.com/r/) -- for interactive data visualization
- [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) -- combination of `dplyr`, `ggplot2` 
- [Bioconductor](https://www.bioconductor.org/) -- for genomic data analysis
- [seqinr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/seqinr/index.html) -- DNA or Protein sequence analysis 
- [MutatioanlPattern](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/MutationalPatterns.html) -- mutational signature analysis 
- [caret](https://topepo.github.io/caret/) -- for machine learning
