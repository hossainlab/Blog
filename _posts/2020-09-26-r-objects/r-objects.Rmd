## Objects 
R has 5 basic or "atomic" classes of objects:

* Numeric(real numbers)
* Integer 
* Complex 
* Character 
* Logical(True or False)

The most basic object in R is a `vector`

* A vector can only contain objects of same class
* BUT: The one exception is a list, which is represented as a vector but can contain objects of different classes 
* Empty vector can be created with the `vector()` function.

## Numbers 
* Numbers in R generally treated as numeric objects(i.e. double precision real numbers)
* If you explicitly want an integer, you need to specify the `L` suffix.
* There is also a special number `Inf` which is represents infinity; e.g. `1 / 0`
* `Inf` can be used in ordinary calculations; e.g. `1/Inf` is `0`
* The value `NaN` represents an undefined value("not a number"); e.g. `0/0` 
* `NaN` can also be thought of as a missing value. 

The numeric constants are 

- integer(`L`)
- double
- complex(`i`) 

```{r}
# create an integer type constant 
i = 5L 
```
```{r}
# check type of objecr
typeof(i)
```

```{r}
# create a double type constant 
d = 22
```
```{r}
# check type of objecr
typeof(d)
```
```{r}
# create a complex type constant 
c = 4i 
```

```{r}
# check type of objecr
typeof(c)
```

## Decimal vs Double vs Float
The Decimal, Double, and Float variable types are different in the way that they store the values. Precision is the main difference where float is a single precision (32 bit) floating point data type, double is a double precision (64 bit) floating point data type and decimal is a 128-bit floating point data type.

* Float - 32 bit (7 digits)
* Double - 64 bit (15-16 digits)
* Decimal - 128 bit (28-29 significant digits)

```

## Integer vs. Double
The two most common numeric classes used in R are integer and double (for double precision floating point numbers). R automatically converts between these two classes when needed for mathematical purposes. As a result, itâ€™s feasible to use R and perform analyses for years without specifying these differences.

# Characters 

Character constants can be represented using either single quotes (') or double quotes (") as delimiters.

```{r}
# create a character type object 
char = "Hello"
```
```{r}
# check type of object 
typeof(char)
```

## Atributes 
R objects can have attributes 

* names, dimnames 
* dimensions(e.g. matrices, arrays)
* class 
* length 
* other user-defined attributes/metadata

Attributes of an object can be accessed using the `attributes()` function.

## Built-in Constants in R 

```{r}
pi # value of pi 
LETTERS
```

```{r}
month.name 
```
